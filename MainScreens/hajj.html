  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 1 Preparation and Intention</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Before you arrive at Makkah to begin Hajj, it’s important to make your intention (niyyah) within your heart. The intention must be to perform the Hajj for the sake of Allah alone, with a desire for good in the hereafter. It should not be done with the intention of being seen by others or for worldly gain.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 2 Entering The State Of Ihram</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Next, you’ll enter into the state of Ihram (ritual purity). For men, this means wearing the designated white cloth with one piece wrapped around your shoulder and one around your waist. Ladies may wear any clothing of their choice but should ensure they observe the rules of Hijab. Face coverings, however, are not permitted. Fully-covering shoes are also not permitted. Footwear must be in the form of sandals for both women and men.
    Ihram describes the spiritual state you enter once you have made the intention to go to Hajj. When over 2.5 million pilgrims descend into Makkah, there should not be any outward distinction between them. Everyone stands equal before Allah (SWT) – one’s status, race, culture, and wealth are irrelevant. The rules around the clothing of Ihramare extremely simple, yet strict and must be adhered to.
    Throughout these holy days and whilst in the state of Ihram , we should also be particularly mindful of our behaviour and words. We should avoid smoking, engaging in sexual relations, swearing, shaving our hair, and cutting our nails. We must also not use perfume or scented soaps.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 3 Tawaf Seven Times</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Tawaf is one of the principal rites of the pilgrimage and refers to walking in circles around the Kaa’bah in an anti-clockwise motion. One Tawaf is made up of seven complete circuits, with each one starting and ending at the black stone, which is situated within the Kaa’bah.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 4 Safa and Marwa</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">After you’ve performed your Tawaf, you’ll then perform what’s known as Sa’i (walking and running between the two hills of Safa and Marwa).
    You’ll begin the Sa’i on the hill of Safa and walk towards the hill of Marwa. You will eventually see the green marker, at which point you will run until the next green marker and continue walking until you reach Marwa. This completes one lap. You will then return to Safa to complete your second lap. Your Sa’i is complete once you have performed a total of seven laps between the hills of Safa and Marwa.
    This is an important ritual in memory of Prophet Ibrahim’s (AS) wife Hajar, and her struggle in the desert in search of water for her son Prophet Isma’il (AS). Sa’i symbolises the ongoing struggle that we encounter throughout our lives, as Hajar experienced herself.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 5 Clip/Shave Hair</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Once Sa’i is complete, men will have their hair clipped or shaved, whilst a woman clips her hair to the length of her fingertip. This marks the completion of your umrah, allowing you to leave Ihram, until the 8th of Dhul Hijjah.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 6 Resting and Praying</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Now that you’ve performed your Umrah, for the rest of this blessed month, you’ll stay in Makkah to complete your spiritual journey of Hajj, surrounded by your fellow Muslim sisters and brothers, SubhanAllah! Make sure to get plenty of rest and make the best use of your time by performing sincere acts of worship. Your Hajj will begin on the 8th Dhul Hijjah.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 7 Re-entering State of Ihram (8th Dhul Hijjah) </text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">It’s very important to note that when you are in a state of Ihram, you are not permitted to smoke, swear, shave, clip your nails, or engage in any form of sexual relations. Fighting and arguments are also forbidden, and participants are prohibited from hunting, killing, or unjustifiably breaking anything. You must also avoid scented products such as perfumes, moisturisers, makeup, or soaps. You may, however, substitute them for unscented toiletries which are permissible to use.</text>
  <text style="margin-top:5px;"><b>لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ، لَبَّيْكَ لاَ شَرِيْكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ، إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ لاَشَرِيْكَ لَكَ</b></text>
  <text style="margin-bottom:5px;">“Here I am, O Allah, here I am, here I am. You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty.You have no partner.”</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">You will then proceed with your Hajj group to the neighbourhood of Mina in Makkah, which is located roughly eight kilometres from the centre of Makkah.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 8 Arrive At Mina</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">Once you arrive in the tent city (neighbourhood) of Mina, you’ll settle into your allocated tent. Here you’ll pray Salah (obligatory prayers), including Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha and Fajr, shortening your four-unit prayers to two units each, without combining them,as stated in the Qu’ran. You’ll spend the night and pray to Allah (SWT), reading the Qur’an and preparing for day two. It’s an important time for spiritual reflection and devotion, so try and make the most of this special night.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 9 Day of ‘Arafah (9th Dhul Hijjah)</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">After  sunrise in Mina, you’ll then head to the plains of ‘Arafah, reciting Istaghfar (asking for forgiveness) and making supplications – marking the Day of ‘Arafah when we ask Allah (SWT) for forgiveness for our sins. Upon reaching the plains of Mount ‘Arafah, pilgrims observe shortened Dhuhr and Asr prayers combined (two rakat instead of four). However, according to Abu Hanifa, the combining of Dhur and Asr is only valid if one prays behind the Imam in the Masjid. 
    Therefore if one was to pray in the tent, then they should not combine both salah. On this day, there will be a sermon delivered from Masjid al-Nimra on Mount ‘Arafah. Try to listen to the Khutbah (sermon) if possible. Your group may also facilitate a translation of this sermon in English. The day of ‘Arafah is one of the most important days for Muslims across the world, as Allah (SWT) refers to the Day of ‘Arafah in Surah al-Maidah as the Day on which He perfected His religion, completed His favours upon His beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) and approved Islam as a way of life!
    So, be sure to stand on the plains of ‘Arafah and make lots of Du’a (supplication), focussing your energy on Allah (SWT), asking Him for forgiveness and blessings for you and your family. Don’t forget to include your friends, relatives, neighbours as well as the wider Ummah (community) in your Du’a on this special day.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 10 Arrive in Muzdalifah</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">After sunset, you’ll depart ‘Arafah and head to Muzdalifah – an open plain between Mina and ‘Arafah. Once you reach Muzdalifah you’ll perform your Maghrib and ‘Isha Salah, one after the other, shortening the ‘Isha Salah to two Rakat.
    As Abdullah ibn Umar (RA) narrates: “The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) offered the Maghrib and ‘Isha prayers together at Muzdalifah with a separate Iqamah (second call to prayer) for each of them and did not offer any optional prayer in between them or after each of them.” [Bukhari] Afterwards, you can then spend the night in worship or resting. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) went to sleep until shortly before Fajr, choosing not to engage in night worship as he normally did. So, don’t be tempted to exhaust yourself but rest instead – you have a long day ahead of you!
    While in Muzdalifah, you may also collect pebbles to perform Rami (the stoning of the devil) over the next three days. The size of the pebbles should be similar to the size of date stones/seeds. You will need a total of 49 pebbles. However, it is advised that you pick up a further 21 pebbles as a precautionary measure to bring your total up to 70.
    When you proceed to the phases of throwing the pebbles at the Jamarat (the stone pillars), you may miss the target, or some pebbles may fall from your hand. Therefore, it’s better to have more than to be short. Pebbles can also be collected from anywhere in Mina.</text>
  <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 11 Rami and Hady (10th Dhul Hijjah & start of Eid al-Adha)</text>
  <text style="margin:5px;">The 10th of Dhul Hijjah is also called the Yawm al-Nahr, or the Day of Sacrifice (Qurbani).
    After performing Fajr Salah you will depart Muzdalifah and go back towards Mina. Remember to continuously recite the Talbiyah. On this day, Pilgrims perform the Hady (sacrificial animal) and also commence the first of three days ‘stoning of the devil’ rite or Rami. Muslims around the world also offer Qurbani during this time and begin the four-day festival of Eid al-Adha. We know this from this verse in the Qur’an:
    “And when you are safe, then, whoever avails the advantage of the ‘Umrah along with the Hajj shall make an offering of whatever animal is available. However, any one who finds none shall fast for three days during Hajj, and for seven days when you return; thus they are ten in all. This is for him whose family folk are not residents of Al-Masjid-ul-Harām.” [Qur’an | 2:196] The stoning of the Jamarat – otherwise referred to as the ‘stoning of the devil’ – is a ritual carried out by Hajj pilgrims whereby pebbles are thrown at three stone structures in Mina across three days.
    The first day of stoning occurs on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah. On this day Muslims also offer Qurbani and celebrate Eid al-Adha. The act of throwing stones at the Jamarat is known as Rami. The ritual of Rami is symbolic of the actions of Ibrahim (AS) when he was faced with the trial of having to sacrifice his son, Isma’il (AS) upon the commandment of Allah (SWT).
    On the way to carry out the commandment, Iblis (Satan) repeatedly tried to tempt Ibrahim’s (AS) into disobeying Allah (SWT). As Ibrahim (AS) reached Jamarat al-Aqaba, Allah (SWT) ordered Angel Jibreel (AS) to instruct Ibrahim (AS) to throw seven stones at Iblis. He obliged, and Iblis fled immediately. The three Jamarat indicate the three places where Iblis tried to dissuade Ibrahim (AS) from obeying the command of Allah. However, the pillars do not contain Iblis, as many people are wrongly led to believe. On the 10th, 11th, and 12th day of Dhul Hijjah, you will perform Rami (the stoning of the devil). The size of the pebbles should be similar to the size of date stones or seeds. You will need a total of 49 pebbles.
    You’ll need a certain number of pebbles for each of the three days. The breakdown is as follows: 7 pebbles for the 10th of Dhul Hijjah. 21 pebbles for the 11th of Dhul Hijjah. 21 pebbles for the 12th of Dhul Hijjah
    Try to carry four small pouches per person for your pebbles. UK coin bags are a good size and convenient to carry. Use the four pouches to group pebbles according to the breakdown above. Once you reach the Jamarat, you will head to Jamarat al-Aqaba, which is the largest pillar, and here you will throw the first seven pebbles at the concrete pillar. You will only pelt this one pillar on the first day. Upon each throw, you’ll say the takbir: اللهُ أَكْبَرُ (ALLAH IS THE GREATEST)</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 12 Qurbani and Eid al-Adha</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">The festival of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, is also celebrated by Muslims around the world on this day who are not on pilgrimage on the 10th Dhul Hijjah. By offering Qurbani (sacrifice), Muslims mark Prophet Ibrahim’s (AS) willingness to sacrifice his son Isma’il (AS) upon the commandment of Allah (SWT).</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 13 Shaving The Head (11th Dhul Hijjah)</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">After offering the Hady, you will proceed to shave or trim your hair if you are male. The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) shaved his hair and this is preferable. A woman trims her hair by the length of a fingertip. Now you are allowed to leave the state of Ihram and wear comfortable clothing. You are also allowed to resume otherwise Halal activities that were forbidden in the Ihram, except for sexual intimacy. It is Sunnah (practice of the Prophet PBUH) to apply perfume as the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) smelt strongly of musk at this point.</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 14 Tawaf al-Ifadha and Saai’ (12th Dhul Hijjah)</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">You will now go to Makkah to perform Tawaf al-Ifadha and then another circuit of Saai’as part of your Hajj rituals. Tawaf al-Ifada and Sa’i are obligatory. You must perform the tawaf al-Ifadha and the Saai’ after the Rami, the Qurbani (sacrifice) and shaving (or trimming) of the head. With the completion of the Tawaf and Saa’i, you are then allowed to relax and do everything that was lawful before entering the Ihram, including engaging in marital relations. You will, however, return to your tents in Mina and continue with the remaining rituals of Hajj.</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 15 The Second Day of Rami</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">On the 11th Dhul Hijjah, you will proceed to your second day of Rami (the stoning of the devil). On this occasion you pelt each of the three pillars in order. You will begin with Jamarah al-Ula (the small pillar), then Jamarah al-Wusta (the second/middle pillar) and finally, Jamarah al-Aqaba (the third/large pillar).  You stop after the first and second Jamarat to make Du’a facing the qibla. Each one should be stoned with seven consecutive pebbles accompanied by the Takbir. Remember to take your spare pebbles with you in case you lose some!</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 16 Spend the night in Mina</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">Once your second Rami is completed, you will return to your camp in Mina and spend the rest of the day and night in worship, making the most of the remaining time you have</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 17 The Third Day of Rami</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">On the afternoon of 12th Dhul Hijjah, you’ll have your final batch of pebbles (21 pebbles) ready to repeat the same steps as the previous day.</text>
    <text style="margin:5px; font-size:120%">STEP 18 Tawaf al-Wida</text>
    <text style="margin:5px;">You’ve now only one step left to perform before completing Hajj and departing from Makkah. The farewell Tawaf is the last rite Muslims must perform. This Tawaf is Wajib (obligatory) according to Hanafis, Shafi’is and Hanbalis but Sunnah according to Malikis and must be performed prior to leaving the boundaries of the Haram. Omitting this Tawaf, without a valid reason, is not deemed lawful in Islam. Ibn Abbas (RA) narrated: “The people were ordered to perform the Tawaf al-Wida as the last thing before leaving (Makkah), except the menstruating women who were excused. “ [Bukhari] For this Tawaf, you will complete seven laps of Tawaf. Then perform two Rakat of Salah and drink Zam Zam water. There is no Sa’i or shaving/trimming of the head after this Tawaf.</text>
